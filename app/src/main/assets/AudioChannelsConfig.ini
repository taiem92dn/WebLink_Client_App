#  AT_VIDEO = 3,     ///< Audio being played as part of a video. By having it as a separate type, it can be handled separately and synchronized with the video.
#  AT_INFO = 4,      ///< An information stream. This could be reading out information (e.g. via TTS) that the user has selected on the screen.
#  AT_PHONECALL = 5, ///< Audio during a phone call
#  AT_ALERT = 6,     ///< Any type of notification sound such as from the user interface, apps, etc. that requires userâ€™s attention
#  AT_GUIDANCE = 7,  ///< Audio during route guidance indicating next maneuver.

# Not providing audio types for a channel makes it the default output for non-matched stream types.  Those may conflict with AT_DEFAULT channels.
